This projecct has the sprites for a 2D-stilized version of Unity's ADAM character.

If I have time, I will add a controller for Adam, so you can play around with it.

The animations were made by the talented artists ![@Okuroy](https://twitter.com/okuroy) and ![@Sparrowspell](https://twitter.com/Sparrowspell)
